This is some traffic route algorithm for Coflow.

Coflow is a collection of parallel flows whose completion time is determined by the completion time of the last flow in the collection.

The goal of the algorithm is to minimize the completion time of a Coflow.

These algorithms that have two language versions (python and go) are just for theoretically proving.
